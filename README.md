# Numerical methods (UC3M)

Problem sets solved for the numerical methods class taken at UC3M

Lecturer for this class was [Jose Ni√±o Mora](http://portal.uc3m.es/portal/page/portal/dpto_estadistica/personal/jose_nino_mora) and the 2 worksheets (problem sets) solved are his work and not mine. Parts of the code are derived from his code.

Most code has been heavily modified though.
